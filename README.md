ðŸ‘‹ Hello there! I'm Alex, a passionate software engineer with a diverse background in Computer Science and Software Engineering. Currently pursuing a Bachelor of Science degree from the University of Washington, I've had the privilege of interning at top-tier companies like Tesla, Zillow, Datadog, and ML Companies, where I've honed my skills and contributed to exciting projects.

ðŸš€ At Tesla, I had the opportunity to work on the Vehicle Software team, utilizing a range of technologies including Ruby, Python, C++, Jenkins, and Docker. My experience at Zillow was equally enriching, where I led a team in developing a Clickstream Reporting tool and spearheaded the integration of GraphQL data into the iOS Notes SDK, among other achievements.
